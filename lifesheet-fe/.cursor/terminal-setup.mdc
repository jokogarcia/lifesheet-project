# Terminal Setup Rules

## Shell Configuration
- Always use `/bin/bash` as the terminal shell
- At the start of each terminal session, run `nvm use 22` to set Node.js version 22
- This ensures consistent Node.js environment across all terminal operations

## Package Manager
- Use `yarn` as the primary package manager for this project
- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Use `yarn test` to run tests
- Use `yarn dev-remote` to start the development server
- Use `yarn build` to build the project

## Development Workflow
1. Start terminal session with `/bin/bash`
2. Run `nvm use 22` to set Node.js version
3. Use `yarn` commands for all package management tasks
4. Follow the existing code style and patterns in the project
